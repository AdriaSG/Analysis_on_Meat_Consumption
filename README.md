### Mastering Data Vosualization in R.
*Tools: R, ggplot, markdown.*

### Abstract
Global average meat consumption per capita has been rising since 1960s, but especially from the 1980s decade to today, driven by population growth and increasing average individual incomes. Although meat means an important source of nutrients, it is also evident that a great consumption of this source of proteins has also a negative environmental impact. The consumption of different types of meat also might lead to negative effects in humanâ€™s health and livestock production can have negative influence toward climate change. In this paper we aim to analyze meat consumption over the last 30 years with a special focus on different types of visualizations for 35 different countries.

### Data format
The dataset used for this analysis comes from two main sources: The World Bank Data and The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). For such purposes. Data from 35 different countries around the globe has been merged fro this analysis, data is given in a period from 1990 to 2020, including OECD predictions until 2029 in some variables. Data has been preprocessed using Python in order to create a more coherent dataset for our visualization analysis. It contains 1520 observations from 29 different variables.
