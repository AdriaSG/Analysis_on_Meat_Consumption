Feeding the world in a sustainable way is one of our most pressing challenges in the coming decades. While
consumption of meat and meat products means an important source of nutrients like proteins, iron and

vitamins, among others to the human diet. It is also clear that this source of proteins has a great environ-
mental impact. Some sources affirm that global demand for meat is growing: over the past 50 years, meat

production has more than tripled. The world now produces more than 340 million tonnes each year.
One of the world’s most pressing challenges is to produce and consume meat, dairy and other protein products
in a way that reduces its environmental impacts. Up to 23% of the total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)
are derived from agriculture, forestry and other land uses, which are among the major contributors to global
warming (IPCC, 2019). Moreover, agricultural overexploitation – larger farm and field sizes, and more use of
pesticides and fertilizers – is causing a loss of natural biodiversity and habitats. Among agricultural practices,
the livestock industry is also an important contributor to global climate change, contributing between 12%
and 18% to the total GHG emissions.

Changing meat consumption habits is an issue hat requires identifying the complex social factors associ-
ated with meat eating and developing policies for effective interventions. Given the importance of this for

worldwide, we found it as a very interesting topic to analyze where is essential to get access to the available
information to find answers to our hypothesis. The present paper was aimed to find interesting visualizations
reviewing the relation of wealth and culture against meat production and its impact on human health and
the environment.

Data format
The dataset used for this analysis comes from two main sources: The World Bank Data and The Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). For such purposes, we had merged different variables
from 35 different countries around the globe, data is given in a period from 1990 to 2020, including OECD
predictions until 2029 in some variables. Data has been preprocessed using python in order to create a more
coherent dataset for our visualization analysis. It contains 1520 observations from 29 different variables.
